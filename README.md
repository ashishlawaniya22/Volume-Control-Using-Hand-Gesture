# Volume-Control-Using-Hand-Gesture

🚀 A Python-based system that lets you control volume using hand gestures—no need to touch your keyboard or mouse! This project utilizes computer vision (OpenCV), hand tracking (MediaPipe), and system audio control (PyCaw) to detect hand movements and adjust the volume in real-time.

🔧 Technologies Used-
🐍 Python
🎥 OpenCV – for real-time video processing
✋ MediaPipe – for hand tracking
🔊 PyCaw – for system audio control

🛠️ How It Works-
Hand Tracking: Detects the hand using MediaPipe.
Gesture Recognition: Measures the distance between thumb and index finger.
Volume Mapping: Maps the distance to system volume levels.
Real-Time Adjustment: Smoothly changes volume using PyCaw.

📌 Features-
✔️ Touchless volume control using hand gestures
✔️ Real-time processing for a seamless experience
✔️ Customizable sensitivity & range
✔️ Lightweight & efficient
